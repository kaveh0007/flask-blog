## Description
This is a project I am currently working on.
In this MVP version I aim to create a CRUD application where users can register/login and can read/write blogs and can comment on other's blogs.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Jinja Templates + Bootstrap + Vanilla JS
- **Backend**: Flask

## Features yet to be included
- Add an OpenAI API call to summarise the blog content
